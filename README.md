# Some Flaws
 * What is going on with the numbers?
    * Separate elevator shafts for different floors
    * Remove congestion
 * The elevator call button is not labled
 * Odd stack of buttons
    * But this may be necessary for the disabled
 * Inconsistent shape and size of buttons
    * Lower utility buttons are small and round
# Some Features
  * Disabled friendly
    * Buttons are low and handles are present
  * Obvious buttons
    * Especially LOBBY
  * Good size
    * LOBBY makes itself large while the other floor buttons do the same
# Some Improvements
  * Make the floor buttons appear in a vertical column
  * Make the utility buttons the same size as the floor buttons
  * Add feedback to the utility buttons
  * Decrease the size of all buttons slightly
    * To help fit in the vertical column
# Improved Sketch

# A touch screen elevator?
  * I think that a touch screen elevator is bad for a few reasons
    * A higher level of maintenance if a problem arises
      * Software engineers may be needed
    * The elevator controls would be needlessly complex
      * Menus menus menus
    * Crashed / bugs in the controls could be devastating
      * At best annoy the passengers
      * At worst the elevator could be stuck closed. Panic ensues
    * The screen could break
      * Either from an angry passenger, neglect, or abuse
# Before the demo
  * A touch screen would add uncertainty to a system that does not need more uncertainties.
  * “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”
  * About the demo
     * This design assumes physical buttons for emergency services and other utilities.

# Some more creative input
  * Mirage hotel now has an identification system
    * No one can go up without a hotel card
    * This adds security in a place that needs it: Vegas
    * This could be used in more apartments / hotels
  * Vertical bars
    * Adds more places for passengers to grab
    * Intended to aid the disabled
